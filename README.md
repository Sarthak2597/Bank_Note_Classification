# Bank Note Classification

Summary:

We use the randomeforest machine learning algorithm to predict whether a currency note from banks is authentic or otherwise. To do this, we take in 4 parameters namely variance, skewness, curtosis and entropy and train our ML model on this. Finally, we create a Flask API using Flassger of the same and dockerize the application.
